## Bubble Sort

     1. Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements in an array and swaps the largest of the two values to  the end.
     2. The worst case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n2): this is because for each iteration n-1 comparisons will be done.
     3. The best case  time complexity will be O(n): this is when the list is already sorted
     4. The space time complexity will be O(1): since only one memory space is required for the temp variable.
